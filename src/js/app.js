// We then offer a "Resume" banner that re-sends the existing history so the
// model continues exactly where it left off — no work is redone.

// Repair dangling tool calls. A tool_use is pushed to history before its tool
// runs (handleToolCalls); an interruption between the two — Stop, a refresh, a
// checkpoint save that lands mid-tool — leaves the tool_use with no matching
// tool_result. The model API rejects a tool_use that has no result, so
// synthesize an error result for every unmatched id. (Only the final,
// interrupted round can be affected — earlier rounds always completed their
// results — so appending at the end keeps the pairing the API expects.)
//
// Idempotent: a second call finds every id already matched and appends nothing.
// Returns the number of results synthesized.
//
// Called on EVERY send path, not just resume: the user is just as likely to type
// a new instruction as to click Resume, and that request carries the same broken
// history. Must run BEFORE the turn appends anything, so each synthesized result
// directly follows its tool_use.

// ---- Mobile background / screen-off resilience ------------------------------
// On phones, backgrounding the browser or letting the screen turn off FREEZES
// the page: JS halts and the OS usually kills the in-flight streaming AI
// request. Two failure shapes follow. Either the stream throws a network error
// once the tab thaws — the transient-retry loop above handles that — or, worse,
// the socket dies SILENTLY and the `for await` over the stream simply never
// yields again: spinner forever, no error, no retry, no resume banner. Three
// defenses, all scoped to an active turn:
//   1. A screen Wake Lock while a build runs, so the screen doesn't turn off
//      mid-build while the user is watching (the most common interruption).
//   2. A return-to-foreground watchdog: when the page comes back from a freeze
//      (or a long-hidden stretch on browsers without the freeze event) and the
//      stream shows no life within a grace window, the attempt is aborted and
//      re-issued through the SAME retry machinery (prepareResumeHistory), so it
//      continues from the last checkpoint instead of hanging forever.
//   3. Retry-budget fairness: transient failures that strike while the page is
//      hidden don't consume the small retry budget (see sendChatMessage), so a
//      phone in a pocket can't exhaust every retry against a dead radio.
// A tab the OS fully DISCARDS reloads on return; that path is already covered
// by the persisted `interrupted` flag + the resume banner in loadChat.

// storage layers hold the same value under the same key:
//
//   local  — localStorage. Written synchronously on every edit (drafts are
//            typing-sized; nothing to debounce, no flush to coordinate) and
//            read synchronously on every restore, so the composer refills
//            instantly at boot even offline. The on-device durability layer.
//   cloud  — puter.kv. A debounced background mirror for signed-in (non-temp)
//            users, so drafts follow them across devices/browsers. Strictly
//            best-effort: every op is fire-and-forget behind the local layer,
//            and any failure degrades to local-only behavior.
//
// Both layers store the JSON envelope {t: text, at: epoch-ms}. The timestamp
// makes cross-device conflicts resolvable by last-write-wins; an EMPTY t is a
// tombstone — "the draft was consumed/emptied at `at`" — so a deletion also
// wins recency comparisons. Without tombstones, a device holding a stale copy
// would resurrect drafts that were already sent elsewhere (the classic
// distributed-deletion bug). Wall clocks can skew between devices; for
// best-effort draft data, last-write-wins is the standard accepted tradeoff.
//
// One draft per context: the open project's chat id, or 'home' for the
// new-chat landing — whose currentChatId is regenerated on every visit, so
// keying by id there would orphan the draft. Keys also carry the username:
// localStorage is per-origin, shared by every account on this browser profile
// (same tradeoff as HOME_GREETING_CACHE_KEY), so an unscoped draft would leak
// one user's unsent text into another's composer. Signed-out typing saves

Respond with ONLY a JSON array (no prose, no markdown code fences) of exactly 5 objects, each with:
- "label": a very short button caption, 2 to 5 words, no trailing punctuation (e.g. "Add a dark mode").
- "prompt": a clear, first-person instruction the user could send to carry out that step, 1 to 2 sentences (e.g. "Add a dark mode toggle and remember my preference between visits.").
